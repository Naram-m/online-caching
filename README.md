# online-caching
The codebase for the papers ["Online Caching with Optimistic Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10590) and ["Online Caching with no Regret: Optimistic Learning via Recommendations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09345).
- To run an experiment, navigate to the accociated main file and execute it. For example, /single_cache/main_mlds.py will run the single cache experiment with the MovieLens (ML) traces. 

Notes: 
- You need to populate the directories of the ML dataset with the actual files that can be found here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
